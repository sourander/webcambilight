## The DIY Ambilight with webcam input

This ambilight clone is meant to work with any TV source; as long as it is visible, this should work. The input data is gathered using a Logitech C920. The software runs on Raspberry Pi. Tested on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Rasbian Stretch Lite.

The project is currently in progress. The first initial steps have been taken.
